# URL Shortener Service

The **URL Shortener** service is a Node.js-based web application that allows users to shorten long URLs into compact, shareable links. The service also supports redirection from the short URL to the original URL. The system leverages **Redis** for caching to ensure optimized response times, high performance, and scalability. Error handling and validation mechanisms are integrated to enhance reliability and robustness.

## üìÇ Design Structure

The application uses the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern for modularity and scalability:

1. **Model**: 
   - Schema for storing URLs (`Urls` schema).
2. **Controller**: 
   - Handles core logic, request validation, and responses.
3. **View**: 
   - Not applicable (REST API).
4. **Utilities**:
   - Error handling (`ApiError` and `ApiResponse` utilities).
   - Redis integration for caching.
