# URL Shortener Service

The **URL Shortener** service is a Node.js-based web application that allows users to shorten long URLs into compact, shareable links. The service also supports redirection from the short URL to the original URL. The system leverages **Redis** for caching to ensure optimized response times, high performance, and scalability. Error handling and validation mechanisms are integrated to enhance reliability and robustness.
